## About

This integration makes **Mistral AI** available as a fully-featured conversation agent inside Home Assistant's built-in Assist voice pipeline. It also registers **Voxtral** (Mistral's own speech-to-text model) as a native HA STT provider — creating two separate devices, one for conversation and one for transcription, just like the official Google Gemini integration.

## Options

Click the integration → **Configure** to change settings.

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **AI model** | `ministral-8b-latest` | Which Mistral model to use |
| **System prompt** | See below | Jinja2 template with AI instructions |
| **Temperature** | `0.7` | Creativity: 0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative |
| **Max tokens** | `1024` | Maximum response length |
| **Control HA** | On | Allow the AI to control exposed devices |
| **Continue conversation** | Off | Keep listening after questions (Experimental) |
| **STT language** | Auto-detect | Language for Voxtral transcription |

### Available models

| Model | Speed | Cost | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ministral-8b-latest` ⭐ | ★★★★★ | $ | Home automation commands — fast, accurate, cheap |
| `ministral-3b-latest` | ★★★★★ | $ | Ultra-simple commands, lowest latency |
| `mistral-small-latest` | ★★★★ | $$ | Balanced: quality and speed |
| `mistral-large-latest` | ★★★ | $$$$ | Complex reasoning, long conversations |
| `open-mistral-nemo` | ★★★★ | $ | Open-source alternative |

> **Recommendation:** Start with `ministral-8b-latest`. It has excellent instruction-following, handles structured JSON output reliably (needed for device control), and costs a fraction of larger models.

### System prompt

The system prompt supports Jinja2 templates:

```jinja2
You are a helpful voice assistant for {{ ha_name }}.
Answer in the same language the user speaks.
Today is {{ now().strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y') }} and the time is {{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}.
Be concise and friendly.
```

**Available template variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{ ha_name }}` | Your Home Assistant location name |
| `{{ now() }}` | Current datetime object |
| `{{ now().strftime(…) }}` | Formatted date/time string |

### Continue conversation (Experimental)

When enabled, the assistant automatically keeps the microphone open after any response that contains a question (`?`). This is implemented using the native `continue_conversation` flag in HA's `ConversationResult` — no separate automation is needed.

> **Note:** This feature requires a satellite device that supports `assist_satellite.start_conversation`. Behaviour may vary between satellite types.

## Controlling devices

Enable **Allow AI to control Home Assistant devices** in the options, then expose the entities you want via **Settings → Voice Assistants → Exposed devices**.

### Example commands

| What you say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Turn off the kitchen light" | `light.turn_off` |
| "Open the blinds" | `cover.open_cover` |
| "Lock the front door" | `lock.lock` |
| "Play something in the living room" | `media_player.media_play` |
| "Activate the movie scene" | `scene.turn_on` |

### Supported domains

`light` · `switch` · `cover` · `media_player` · `fan` · `climate` · `lock` · `alarm_control_panel` · `scene` · `script` · `automation` · `homeassistant`

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

---

## Using as a service action

Use `conversation.process` in automations or scripts:

```yaml
action: conversation.process
data:
  agent_id: conversation.mistral_ai_conversation
  text: "What is the temperature in the living room?"
response_variable: result
```

The response text is in `result.response.speech.plain.speech`.

### Example: Smart doorbell notification

```yaml
alias: Smart doorbell notification
sequence:
  - action: conversation.process
    data:
      agent_id: conversation.mistral_ai_conversation
      text: >
        The doorbell rang at {{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}.
        Write a short, friendly notification message.
    response_variable: ai_result
  - action: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      title: "Doorbell 🔔"
      message: "{{ ai_result.response.speech.plain.speech }}"
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

---

## Speech recognition (STT)

A `stt.mistral_ai_stt_voxtral` entity is registered automatically.

### Voxtral specifications

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | `voxtral-mini-latest` |
| Supported format | WAV (16-bit, 16 kHz, mono PCM) |
| Languages | 60+ with auto-detect |
| Pricing | ~$0.003 per minute |

### Setting STT language

In the options, select a language from the dropdown for best accuracy, or leave it on **Auto-detect**.

## FAQ

**Q: The integration does not appear in the Voice Assistants dropdown.**
A: Make sure you performed a full restart (not just reload) and cleared any `__pycache__` directories.

**Q: I get a 400 Bad Request error.**
A: Check the HA logs for the full error body. A common cause is an invalid model name or a temperature value outside 0.0–1.0.

**Q: Can I use TTS with this integration?**
A: Mistral has no TTS API. Use Piper (local, free), Google TTS, or ElevenLabs as your TTS provider in the voice assistant pipeline.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: With `ministral-8b-latest` and typical home use, expect less than €1–2 per month. Voxtral STT adds ~€0.003/minute. See [mistral.ai/pricing](https://mistral.ai/pricing/).

**Q: Does continue conversation work on all satellites?**
A: It requires a satellite that supports the `assist_satellite` integration and `start_conversation`. It has been tested with ESPHome voice satellites. Behaviour on other devices may vary.

**Q: Are my conversations stored?**
A: Mistral AI processes requests via their servers. See their [privacy policy](https://mistral.ai/privacy-policy) for details.

## Release Notes

### v0.2.0 — 2026-02-23
**Breaking:** Removed Agent mode — integration now uses Model mode only.

- **Removed:** Agent mode and all Mistral Console agent configuration. All configuration is now done directly in Home Assistant.
- **Added:** `continue_conversation` option — when enabled, the assistant automatically keeps the microphone open after responses containing a question. Implemented natively via HA's `ConversationResult.continue_conversation` flag (no external automation required). Labelled *Experimental*.
- **Updated:** Model list — removed deprecated `ministral-7b-latest` and `open-codestral-mamba`. Added `ministral-8b-latest` (new default) and `ministral-3b-latest`. `ministral-8b-latest` is the recommended model for home automation: fast, cost-effective, and excellent at structured instruction-following.
- **Fixed:** All hardcoded Dutch strings in Python code replaced with English fallbacks. UI labels remain available in both English and Dutch via translation files.
- **Fixed:** Service confirmation messages no longer start with "Done!" / "Klaar!". Format is now e.g. *"Kitchen light has been turned off."*
- **Fixed:** Wrong GitHub URL in documentation corrected from `SnarfNL/mistral_conversation` to `SnarfNL/HA_MistralAI`.
- **Fixed:** Removed "(only in Model mode)" labels from all UI options since Agent mode no longer exists.
- **Optimised:** `_post_chat` error handling consolidated; `HomeAssistantError` and `aiohttp.ClientError` caught in a single handler. Error messages are now in English.
- **Optimised:** History trimming now preserves exactly the last 40 messages (20 turns) using a single slice operation.

---

### v0.1.8 — 2026-02-21
- **Added:** `icon.png` (128 px) and `icon@2x.png` (256 px) — Mistral M-logo on orange rounded-square background.
- **Added:** `images/` folder with 256 px and 512 px versions for submission to the home-assistant/brands repository.
- **Added:** Comprehensive `README.md` modelled after the BlaXun integration.
- **Fixed:** STT and conversation entities now have **separate `DeviceInfo`** with distinct `identifiers`, matching the pattern used by the Google Gemini integration.
- **Fixed:** `MistralSTTEntity` was missing `DeviceInfo` entirely — caused WebSocket handler errors (`Received binary message for non-existing handler`).
- **Fixed:** PCM-to-WAV wrapping now always applied regardless of `metadata.format`, fixing 400 errors on the Voxtral endpoint.
- **Fixed:** Full HTTP response body now logged on any 4xx/5xx from the chat API, making debugging possible.

---

### v0.1.7 — 2026-02-21
- **Fixed:** STT 400 error: HA always delivers raw PCM bytes; the WAV wrapper was incorrectly skipped when `metadata.format == WAV`.
- **Fixed:** Conversation 400 error: error response body was silently discarded; now logged at ERROR level.
- **Fixed:** `HomeAssistantError` raised inside `_post_chat` was not caught by the `aiohttp.ClientError` handler — added combined except clause.
- **Fixed:** `DeviceInfo` added to `MistralSTTEntity` to allow correct HA device registration.

---

### v0.1.6 — 2026-02-21
- **Added:** Speech-to-text (STT) platform using Mistral's **Voxtral Mini** (`voxtral-mini-latest`).
- **Added:** Agent mode — use a pre-configured agent from Mistral Console via `agent_id`.
- **Added:** STT language selector (dropdown with 60+ languages + Auto-detect).
- **Changed:** Conversation and STT entities registered as separate HA devices.

---

### v0.1.5 — 2026-02-21
- **Added:** `icon.png` and `icon@2x.png` in the component directory.
- **Added:** Full `README.md` with installation guide, option descriptions, automation examples and FAQ.

---

### v0.1.4 — 2026-02-21
- **Fixed:** Mistral API rejects `temperature` values above 1.0 — clamped to `0.0–1.0`.
- **Fixed:** Removed `top_p` from API payload (cannot be sent together with `temperature`).
- **Added:** `ConversationEntityFeature.CONTROL` to enable device control.
- **Improved:** JSON extraction from AI response now handles markdown code fences.

---

### v0.1.3 — 2026-02-21
- **Fixed:** `MistralOptionsFlow.__init__` tried to set `self.config_entry` which is a read-only property in HA 2024.x — removed `__init__`.
- **Added:** `_async_handle_message` (HA 2024.6+ API) with `async_process` fallback for older versions.

---

### v0.1.2 — 2026-02-21
- **Fixed:** Conversation agent did not appear in the Voice Assistants dropdown because entities were registered directly instead of via the `conversation` platform.
- **Changed:** Switched to `async_forward_entry_setups` with `PLATFORMS = ["conversation"]`.

---

### v0.1.1 — 2026-02-21
- **Fixed:** 500 error in config flow caused by incorrect OptionsFlow structure.
- **Changed:** Deprecated `conversation.async_set_agent()` replaced by proper platform setup.

---

### v0.1.0 — 2026-02-21
- Initial release.
- Mistral AI selectable as conversation agent in HA Assist.
- Configurable model, system prompt, temperature and max tokens via the UI.
- Home Assistant device control via spoken commands.
- Conversation history per session.
